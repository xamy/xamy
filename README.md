- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xamy

I am a designer, artist, UI / UIX guy, pixel man, 
animation dood, programming monke (though I'm not a huge fan of having to program),
quite frankly a genius (read: idea guy) and also extremely, absolutely incomparably humble.

I also don't care much about typography in READMEs.

Thank you for your attention. It's amazing how you even ended up here, lol.
